    "# Programming Assignment: AI Powered Request Dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of AI-powered chat and large language models, delivering a great response begins with understanding the user's prompt. Before any system can act, it must first know what is being asked. Is the user asking a question? Do they want to brainstorm ideas? Or are they requesting a summary?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the pivotal challenge you will solve in this assignment. You're going to build an **AI Powered Request Dispatcher**, the essential first step for any advanced AI system. Your model will learn to analyze and classify the intent behind any user request, ensuring it gets routed to the correct specialized tool for a perfect response. Think of it as the smart front door for a powerful AI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will guide you through the entire process, from handling raw data to fine-tuning a sophisticated, pre-trained model. You'll see firsthand how foundational concepts come together to create a practical, real-world tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you'll do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preparing the Data**: You'll start with the **Databricks Dolly 15k dataset**, a high-quality collection of instructions, and preprocess it by consolidating categories and converting them into numerical labels ready for the model.\n",
    "* **Setting Up the Foundation**: You will leverage **DistilBERT**, a fast and powerful pre-trained model, and its tokenizer to serve as the core of your dispatcher.\n",
    "* **Assembling the Data Feed**: You'll construct a custom PyTorch `Dataset` for on-the-fly tokenization and build `DataLoaders` to efficiently batch and serve data to the model during training.\n",
    "* **Optimizing the Fine-Tuning Process**: You'll implement advanced strategies to make your training more effective. This includes calculating **class weights** to handle imbalanced data and using partial freezing for efficient fine-tune training.\n",
    "* **Training and Evaluation**: Finally, you'll bring everything together to train your dispatcher, analyze its performance with a confusion matrix, and test its real-world capabilities on new, unseen instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin building the intelligent core of your next great AI application!"

    "* All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",

    "## 1 - The Databricks Dolly 15k Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Every great AI system is built on a foundation of high-quality data. For your **AI Powered Request Dispatcher**, that foundation is the [Databricks Dolly 15k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehilsanyal/databricks-dolly-15k-dataset), an open source, instruction following dataset created by thousands of Databricks employees. It contains over 15,000 high quality prompt and response pairs designed to make language models more helpful and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your task of building a dispatcher, you will focus on two key columns: `instruction`, which contains the user prompt, and `category`, which describes the type of task the instruction represents (e.g., `open_qa`, `summarization`, `creative_writing`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Dataset Was Augmented\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a truly robust dispatcher, you can't just rely on the original data. That's why this dataset has been augmented using a professional technique called **back-translation**. This process created new training examples that are grammatically different but semantically similar to the original ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, each instruction was translated from English into 10 different intermediate languages, such as Arabic, Urdu, and German, and then immediately translated back to English. This process created new sentences with slightly different wording but the same core meaning. These unique variations were then combined with the original data to create a larger and more diverse set of examples for your training, growing the dataset from approximately 15,000 to 26,000 instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in the specifics, you can take a look at the `augment_dataset_with_back_translation` function that was used for it, which can be found in the `helper_utils.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this powerful, augmented dataset in hand, your first mission is to preprocess and shape it into the perfect fuel for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='1-1'></a>\n",
    "### 1.1 - Preparing the Instruction Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your journey from raw data to a trained model begins with the first step of **preprocessing**. This is where you clean, refine, and structure your dataset to ensure your dispatcher learns from clear and meaningful signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the dataset from `\"./databricks-dolly-15k-dataset/databricks-dolly_augmented.csv\"` as a DataFrame and remove any incomplete rows to ensure data integrity."

You have your datasets, but there's a practical challenge to solve before you can create batches: your tokenized instructions are all different lengths, in other words each sentence has different number of words. To train your model efficiently, each batch of data must be a uniform tensor. To handle this, you need a component that can dynamically pad the shorter sequences so that every instruction in the batch matches the length of the longest one. This will ensure perfectly shaped, rectangular tensors are always fed to your dispatcher. You need a **data collator**.\n",

    "Congratulations, your model is trained! But is it any good? This optional section is all about answering that question. **Evaluation** is where you pressure-test your model to discover its true capabilities. You'll first perform a quantitative analysis to see the hard numbers on its performance and then move to a qualitative test, challenging it with new instructions to see how it behaves in real-world scenarios. Let's see what your dispatcher can do!\n",

    "The first step in your evaluation is to look beyond single-number metrics. To truly understand your dispatcher, you need to see not just if it was right or wrong, but how it was wrong. This is where a confusion matrix comes in. This powerful visualization breaks down the model's predictions for every category, revealing exactly where it's confident and where it's getting confused. Is it consistently mistaking `brainstorming` for `creative_writing`? The confusion matrix will tell all."

    "\n",
    "You will feed it a variety of prompts and observe its classifications in real-time. Does it correctly identify a question? Can it spot a request for a summary? This is where you see if you model has truly learned to generalize. \n",

    "## Conclusion: Your Dispatcher is Ready for Duty!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built, fine-tuned, and tested a complete **AI Powered Request Dispatcher**. You started with a raw dataset and transformed it into a smart, efficient classification model capable of understanding and directing user intent, a vital component in any modern AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this journey, you've put theory into practice. You saw how a pipeline of **tokenization**, where text is broken into smaller units, and **tensorization**, where tokens become numerical tensors for the model, forms the bedrock of any NLP task. You harnessed the power of a pre-trained model, **DistilBERT**, saving immense time and leveraging its deep, pre-existing knowledge of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, you went beyond basic training. By implementing **weighted loss** to tackle class imbalance and applying a **partial-freezing** strategy, you engaged in the kind of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that makes developing high-performance models both practical and cost-effective. You didn't just build a model; you engineered a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispatcher you've created is more than just an assignment. It represents a fundamental building block for countless advanced applications, from sophisticated chatbots and intelligent search engines to automated content creation tools. You now have the skills and the hands-on experience to build the smart systems of the future. Well done!"
